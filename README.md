## Pi-hole without Raspberry Pi

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is an excellent tool to block advertisments and trackers in your local network. The default setup is to install it on a seperate [RaspebrryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and route your network traffic through it.

If you don't have a RaspberryPi or don't want to do a more involving setup you can run Pi-hole on your local computer in a docker container.
